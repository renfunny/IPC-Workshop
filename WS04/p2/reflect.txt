Q1. I added some comments to aid others programmers understand my code. The code itself 
is very straight forward and easy to follow which follow proper naming conventions and 
are formatted correctly.

Q2. If nesting were not possible the code for this workshop would be much longer and 
harder to understand. It would be possible to do this workshop without nesting but it 
would require much more time and planning to do so effectively.

Q3. When using if statements only the programm will have to go through each possible if 
statement even if one was already executed, this would be a big waste of resourses. When 
using if/else the programm will only execute the needed statement and break out, making 
the programm more efficient.

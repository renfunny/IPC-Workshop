Q1. 
	dailyServings >= 1 && dailyServings <= 4
	dailyServings >= 5 && dailyServings <= 9
	dailyServings >= 10
A) There were 2 relational expressions used; more or equal to (>=), and less or equal to (<=)
B) There was 1 logical expression used, AND (&&)

Q2.
	PRODUCT3_ID != PRODUCT1_ID && PRODUCT3_ID != PRODUCT2_ID
	!(PRODUCT3_ID == PRODUCT1_ID || PRODUCT3_ID == PRODUCT2_ID)

Q3. Here we organize the variables based on their types:
  
	const double GRAMS_IN_LBS = 453.5924;
    	int coffeeWeight1, coffeeWeight2, coffeeWeight3, dailyServings;
   	char coffeeType1, coffeeType2, coffeeType3, creamSuggested1, creamSuggested2, creamSuggested3, coffeeStrength, withCream;

Here we organize the variables based on their relationship (information about coffee being sold and then how the customer likes his coffee), prioritizing constant variables:

	const double GRAMS_IN_LBS = 453.5924;
	char coffeeType1, coffeeType2, coffeeType3, creamSuggested1, creamSuggested2, creamSuggested3;
	int coffeeWeight1, coffeeWeight2, coffeeWeight3;
	char coffeeStrength, withCream;
	int dailyServings;

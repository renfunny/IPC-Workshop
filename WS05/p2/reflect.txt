Q1. Using varaibles and macros to represent information makes the code more readable and easier to follow. It also allows us to change 
the values of these variables in the future without breaking the code or having to edit every instance of that variable. In this workshop 
using variables like the LOG_MAX allows us to increase the number of days our log can assess, easily switching from 3 days to 30 by simply 
changing one variable. It also creates better readability, allowing other programmers to read and understand our code in the future. Lastly 
it helps us store values that are constantly changing, such as the sumM, sumM, and sumALL variables, which are used to store the ratings 
as they are added for each log. 

Q2. If the logic that sums and performs the average was added in the validation iteration then the code would be a bit harder to 
understand, its always best practice to have the calculations in one place and have the validation in another so the code is clear and 
easier to read. Its also better because any calculations wont be done unless the values are already set and follow the required range. 
This makes our code clear, easier to read, and it allows us to change or range and number of iterations easily without breaking anything.
